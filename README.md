Dear Readers,

In the following description, I would like to show you how to cost-effectively access the data from your Tuya temperature and humidity sensors at homeâ€”without the need for a Gateway or other magic boxes.

Here is the temperature sensor: <img width="370" height="373" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37452922-8a3f-4863-b9ea-9b5a01f98708" />

The first step is to flash the firmware on the sensors with a PVVX (https://pvvx.github.io/TH05F/) bootloader and then switch them to Application mode.

1. To flash them, you first need to disassemble the thermometers:

2. You need to get an UART to USB converter
4. Connect the solder pads to the pins using wires and solder, according to the table below.
    Adapter	Device
    GND	-Vbat
    +3.3V	+Vbat
    TX	RX1
    RX	TX1
    RTS	RESET
5. Download this Python file ( https://github.com/MakersFunDuck/humidity-temperature-sensor-TH05F/blob/main/rdwr_phy62x2.py) and run the correct command: python3 rdwr_phy62x2.py -p COM11 -e -r wh BOOT_XXX_vXX.hex
6. Reassemble the sensor and try to connect to it via Bluetooth using the following website: https://pvvx.github.io/THB2/web/PHY62x2BTHome.html
